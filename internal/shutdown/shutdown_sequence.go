)

// NewSequence creates a builder that can then be used to configure and create a shutdown sequence.
//
// A sequence contains a list of actions, a timeout and an exit function. The list of actions is built from objects
// like HTTP servers and gRPC servers as well as custom functions. Servers are stopped gracefull, funtions are just
// called, assuming that they will know how to the things that they manage. When possible it is better to add objects
// instead of custom functions, as the shutdown sequence already knows how to stop them gracefully and in the right
// order.
//
// Actions are grouped by priority and executed from highest to lowest priority. Actions with the same priority are
// executed simultaneously in separate goroutines.
//
// The exit function will be called after all the actions have finished, or when the configured timeout expires,
// whatever happens first.
//
// Functions receive a context as parameter, and return an error. For example, a function that removes a temporary
// directory could be added like this:
//
//	// Perform some initialization task that requires a temporary directory:
//	tmpDir, err := os.MkdirTemp("", "*.tmp")
//	if err != nil {
//		...
//	}
//
//	// Create the shutdown sequence, and remember to remove the temporary directory:
//	sequence, err := shutdown.NewSequence().
//		SetLogger(logger).
//		AddAction("remove-tmp", 0, func (ctx context.Context) error {
//			return os.RemoveAll(tmpDir)
//		}).
//		Build()
//	if err != nil {
//		...
//	}
//
//	// Eventually start the shutdown sequence:
//	sequence.Start(0)
//
// Actions can also be added after the initial creation of the sequence:
//
//	// someFunc receives the shutdown sequence that was configured and created somewhere else.
//	func someFunc(shutdown *shutdown.Sequence) error {
//		// Create a temporary directory:
//		tmpDir, err := os.MkdirTemp("", "*.tmp")
//		if err != nil {
//			return err
//		}
//
//		// Remember to delete the directory during shutdown:
//		sequence.AddAction("remove-tmp", 0, func (ctx context.Context) error {
//			return os.RemoveAll(tmpDir)
//		}
//		...
//	}
//
// The default exit function is os.Exit, and there is usually no need to change it. If needed it can be changed using
// the SetExit method of the builder. For example, in unit tests it is convenient to avoid exiting the process:
//
//	sequence, err := shutdown.NewSequence().
//		SetLogger(logger).
//		SetExit(func (code int) {)).
//		Build()
//	if err != nil {
//		...
//	}
//
// The actions run with a context that has the timeout set with the SetTimeout method of the builder (1 minute by
// default). If the actions take longer than the timeout, the remaining actions will be skipped and the exit function will
// be called anyway, which usually means that the process will exit.
//
// Note that actions are responsible for honouring the timeout set in the context, the sequence can't and will not stop
// such them, because there is no way to do that in Go. It will however call the exit function, and if it is the default
// os.Exit it will kill the process and therefore all goroutines.
//
// When the Start method is called the shutdown sequence will start immediately unless a delay has been specified in
// the configuration (using the SetDelay method of the builder). This is intended for situations where some shutdown
// action is started outside of the control of the shutdown sequence.
//
// The shutdown sequence can also be configured to automatically start when certain signals are received. For example in
// Unix systems you will probably want to start the sequence when the SIGKILL or SIGTERM signals are received:
//
//	sequence, err := shutdown.NewSequence().
//		SetLogger(logger).
//		AddSignals(syscall.SIGKILL, syscall.SIGTERM).
//		Build()
//	if err != nil {
//		...
